## Required
- [ X ] Create New Project in Android Studio
- [ X ] Add a view for the front side of the flashcard to display the question
- [ X ] Add a view for the back side of the flashcard to display the answer
- [ X ] Build in logic to show the answer side when the card is tapped
- [ X ] Push code to GitHu
## Optional
- [ X ] toggle the flashcard between the question side and the answer side
- [ X ] Style the question and answer side of the card to better distinguish between the two sides
- [ X ] Add selectable multiple choice answers beneath the card
   - [ X ] Change the background color of the multiple choice answers when clicked to indicate whether the question was answered correctly
      -Slight variation where the correct answer isn't shown on selection, since I coded in a reset to the answer selection.
- [ X ] Further customize and style the card
   - No borders added for simpler UI
